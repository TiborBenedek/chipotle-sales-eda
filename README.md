# Chipotle Sales EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Chipotle sales transaction data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores Chipotle sales data to better understand:
- Best-selling menu items by quantity and revenue
- Price distribution and detection of outliers
- Sales patterns across product categories (e.g., Chicken, Steak, Veggie)

The goal is to clean the dataset, engineer meaningful features, and extract business insights through data visualization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
Chipotle sales dataset in TSV format containing transactional order data.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (price conversion, missing values handling)
- Feature engineering (unit price, product category extraction)
- Aggregation and exploratory analysis
- Visualization of trends and distributions

## 📈 Key Findings
- Chicken-based items are the most frequently purchased products
- A small number of menu items drive a large portion of total revenue
- Item prices show clear clustering with a few high-value outliers

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Predictive modeling of sales trends
